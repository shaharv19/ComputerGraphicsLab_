week 4: imported and coded animation to the character and adjusting each animation: aim, shoot ,jump ,crouch(after long tests and trying to adjust i decided to not include movmeent animations because they distorted the game himself).<br />

week 5: continued working on the arrow releasing mechanics, and started working the AI funcunality.

week 6:still need to conduct research as i didnt complete the AI funcuanlity but made a progress, done with aim mechanic which include the string pulling and the arrow that goes back in correlation to the invest power.<br />

week 7:Miloim.

week 8:done with the Ai functions, including avoiding obstacles, following the player and shooting arrows on him, the accuracy of the arrows depends on the difficulty of the Ai(Easy-in probability of 1 to 8 the arrow will be accurate .Medium-in probability of 1 to 5 the arrow will be accurate Hard-in probability of 1 to 3 the arrow will be accurate). +made 2 new scenes one for main menu and one for options to pick the level.if the player didnt choose any level the defualt level will be Easy.
